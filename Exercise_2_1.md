# Exercise 2.1

## A comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks

**1. How are network embeddings and GCNs related?**

With Network Embeddings a low-dimensional representation of the nodes within a network can be represented while preserving the network structure. Further, these representations can be used for training common machine learning algorithms for downstream tasks such as classification, clusteringâ€¦
One of approaches to generate Network embeddings are autoencoder algorithms.  In this system, the encoder uses Graph Convolutional Network layers  to get the representations of each node.

**2. What are the potential outputs of GCNs? Please describe one use-case for each potential output.**


**3. What value is added by Graph Attention Networks over GCNs? What are the potential disadvantages?**


**4. Why are GCNs relevant for computer vision?**

Many computer vision tasks can leverage on the semantic relationships of objects inside a picture or video. For instance, point clouds can represent different objects in a 2D or 3D space, and its topologies can be explored with graph convolution networks.
Alternative approaches are human action recognition, where human bodies ar a set of connected edges which represent the human skeleton. Further, spatial-temporal analysis of the skeleton can represent action patterns.
